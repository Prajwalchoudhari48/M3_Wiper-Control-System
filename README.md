# M3_Wiper-Control-System


 
Windshield wipers plays a key role during adverse weather conditions by wiping the rain unceasingly over the windshield area and delivers a clear image to the driver. A windshield wiper is a very significant part that authorizations a driver to collect the visual data at the time of precipitation of rain from the vehicle components aspect that influences the driver's safety and comfort.

A wiper speed control system for an vehicle wiper orders the functioning speed of a wiper in accord with the total rain falling on the windshield. This is a very much essential component in each automobile as it avoids the risk of accidents during rainy conditions.

The goals of this project are to provide wiping systems for older cars, to improve the system by employing actuators and pull switches (using the same switch for multiple purposes by stepwise switching), and to regulate the engine and wiper speed with a single switch.
